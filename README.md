 ## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install)
- [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Quickstart

1. Clone this repository and enter it
    ```bash
    # Clone the repo:
    git clone git@github.com:mickkc/wordpress-docker.git

    # Enter the directory:
    cd wordpress-docker
    ```
2. Copy the `example.env` and configure the server to your liking.
    ```bash
    # Copy it:
    cp example.env .env

    # Edit it:
    nano .env
    ```
3. Start the server using `docker compose`:
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d --build
    ```
4. You can now access your server on port `8080` (http://localhost:8080).

## Usage

### Configuration

The following environment variables **need to be defined** in your `.env`:

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| DB_USERNAME | The database user's name. Default is `wordpress`. |
| DB_PASSWORD | The database user's password. **Required.** |
| DB_ROOT_PASSWORD | The root password for the database. **Also required.** |

The variables are used in both the wordpress and mysql container, so they only need to be specified once inside your `.env`.

> [!TIP]
> You can use `openssl rand -hex 32` to generate a long, secure password.

### Commands

- Starting the containers: `docker compose up`
    - To run the container in the background, use the detached option: `docker compose up -d`
- Stopping the containers: `docker compose down`
- List containers and their status: `docker compose ps`
    - To also show stopped containers, use `docker compose ps -a`
- Updating the images: `docker compose pull`

## Technical information

In the [docker-compose.yml](/docker-compose.yml), there are two services:

- **wordpress**: The main container.
    - Uses the [`wordpress` image](https://hub.docker.com/_/wordpress).
    - Loads the database configuration from the `.env` file.
    - Depends on the `db`-service.
    - Part of the `wordpress-network` network, just like the `db`-container.
    - Restarts, unless it gets explicitly stopped.
- **db**: The database container.
    - Uses the [`mysql` image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql).
    - Also loads the database configuration into the appropriate variables that the mysql server expects.
    - Stores the data in the `db-data` volume, also defined in the `docker-compose.yml`
    - Also part of the `wordpress-network` network, so it's reachable by the wordpress container.
    - Restarts, unless it gets explicitly stopped.

The volumes and networks used by the containers are defined at the bottom.

The wordpress container connects to `db:3306`, where `db` is the hostname (in docker compose, the service name is the hostname of the container inside the network). The port `3306` is the default mysql port. It does not need to be mapped using `ports:`, because its only used inside the network, and not the host machine.
